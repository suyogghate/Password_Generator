This is a basic react mini project called "Password Generator". This project is perfect for understanding the concepts of react hooks like useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef.
I have also implemented a copy button in which we can copy the password. This can done with the help of useCallback Hook.
All the hooks used in this project are mentioned below with brief definitions.Do check it out.

useState: Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it.Link: https://react.dev/reference/react/useState
useCallback: useCallback will return a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the inputs has changed.Link: https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback
useRef: useRef returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.
Note that useRef() is useful for more than the ref attribute. It’s handy for keeping any mutable value around similar to how you’d use instance fields in classes. Link: https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef
useEffect: Accepts a function that contains imperative, possibly effectful code.Link: https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect
